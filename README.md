# Welcome to your Rork app

## Project info

This is a native cross-platform mobile app created with [Rork](https://rork.com)

**Platform**: Native iOS & Android app, exportable to web
**Framework**: Expo Router + React Native

## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your native mobile application.

### **Use Rork**

Simply visit [rork.com](https://rork.com) and prompt to build your app with AI.

Changes made via Rork will be committed automatically to this GitHub repo.

Whenever you make a change in your local code editor and push it to GitHub, it will be also reflected in Rork.

### **Use your preferred code editor**

If you want to work locally using your own code editor, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Rork.

If you are new to coding and unsure which editor to use, we recommend Cursor. If you're familiar with terminals, try Claude Code.

The only requirement is having Node.js & Bun installed - [install Node.js with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [install Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)

Follow these steps:

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
bun i

# Step 4: Start the instant web preview of your Rork app in your browser, with auto-reloading of your changes
bun run start-web

# Step 5: Start iOS preview
# Option A (recommended):
bun run start  # then press "i" in the terminal to open iOS Simulator
# Option B (if supported by your environment):
bun run start -- --ios
```

### **Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with the most popular native mobile cross-platform technical stack:

- **React Native** - Cross-platform native mobile development framework created by Meta and used for Instagram, Airbnb, and lots of top apps in the App Store
- **Expo** - Extension of React Native + platform used by Discord, Shopify, Coinbase, Telsa, Starlink, Eightsleep, and more
- **Expo Router** - File-based routing system for React Native with support for web, server functions and SSR
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **React Query** - Server state management
- **Lucide React Native** - Beautiful icons

## How can I test my app?

### **On your phone (Development Build)**

1. Build and install a development client on your device (see **Creating a Custom Development Build** below).
2. Start Metro in dev-client mode with `bun run start` (or `bun run start-tunnel` for remote devices).
3. Open the installed development build and connect to the running project.

### **In your browser**

Run `bun start-web` to test in a web browser. Note: The browser preview is great for quick testing, but some native features may not be available.

### **iOS Simulator / Android Emulator**

This project is configured to use **Expo Development Builds** instead of Expo Go so native modules and config plugins always match your runtime.

If you have Xcode (iOS) or Android Studio installed:

```bash
# iOS Simulator
bun run start -- --ios

# Android Emulator
bun run start -- --android
```

## How can I deploy this project?

### **Publish to App Store (iOS)**
